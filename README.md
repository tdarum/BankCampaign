This repo covering end to end data modeling and prediction using `data_bank_marketing_campaign.csv`

## Model Experimentation 
- Strategy 1 : randomly choose model (LGBM) and fine tune - use code `Capstone Project Module 3 Theresia.ipynb`
- Strategy 2 : train some models and compare the result - From this second strategy the result shows that the best model are LGBM, logistic regression and random forrest - use code `Capstone Project Module 3 Theresia.ipynb`
- Strategy 3 : add train model voting and stacking from the best 3 models and compare + Fine tuning the result - use code `Capstone Project Module 3 Theresia 2nd.ipynb`
- Strategy 4 :  add catboost model experimentation - use code `Capstone Project Module 3 Theresia Porto.ipynb`
